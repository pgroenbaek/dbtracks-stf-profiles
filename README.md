# DBTracks STF Profiles

An attempt to mimic DBTracks as best as possible using the OpenRails STF track profile format.

These profiles are meant to enable use of the superelevation feature in OpenRails together with Norbert Rieger's DBTracks.


## Usage

This repository only contains the STF track profiles. The textures needed can be obtained from the [DBTracks package](https://the-train.de/downloads/entry/11252-dbtracks/).

More information on track profiles in OpenRails is [available here](https://static.openrails.org/files/OpenRails-Testing-How%20to%20Provide%20Track%20Profiles%20for%20Open%20Rails%20Dynamic%20Track.pdf).
