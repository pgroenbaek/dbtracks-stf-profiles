# DBTracks XML Profiles

An attempt to mimic DBTracks in the OpenRails XML track profile format.

Meant to enable use of the superelevation feature in OpenRails together with Norbert Rieger's DBTracks.


## Usage

This repository only contains the XML track profiles.

The textures need to be obtained from the [DBTracks package](https://the-train.de/downloads/entry/11252-dbtracks/).
