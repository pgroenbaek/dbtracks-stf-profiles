# DBTracks STF Profiles

This is an attempt to mimic DBTracks as best as possible using the Open Rails STF track profile format.

These track profiles enable use of the superelevation feature in Open Rails together with Norbert Rieger's DBTracks.


## Installation

TODO How to add them to a route

This repository only contains the STF track profiles. The textures needed can be obtained from the [DBTracks package](https://the-train.de/downloads/entry/11252-dbtracks/).

## Usage

TODO How to use
TODO How to enable superelevation in Open Rails

More information on track profiles in Open Rails is [available here](https://static.openrails.org/files/OpenRails-Testing-How%20to%20Provide%20Track%20Profiles%20for%20Open%20Rails%20Dynamic%20Track.pdf).


## Roadmap

The plan is to add STF profiles for all DBTracks profiles.
